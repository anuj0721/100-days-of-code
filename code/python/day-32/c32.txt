An example of withheld tax calculation goes like this. Sam is entitled to fortnightly payment of $1870. To calculate income tax applicable, an estimate of Xyz’s annual income is needed. There are 52.143 weeks in a year. An estimation of annual income will therefore be $1870 × 52.143 / 2 = $48,753.705 or $48,753 after rounding down. From the table, the applicable tax rate is 28%. Hence, the amount of tax to withhold will be 28% of $1870 = $523.60, and Xyz will be payed an after-tax salary of $1346.40 in this fortnight.
