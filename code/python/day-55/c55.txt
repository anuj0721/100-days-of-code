3. Assume a=1, b=2, c=3,....z=26. Now, given a string, find all possible codes that string can generate. Give a count as well as print the strings. 

   Rules - Do not use itertools methods.

   Example: 
   Input: 1123
   You need to general all valid alphabet codes from this string. 

   Output List 
   aabc # a = 1, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 
   kbc # since k is 11, b = 2, c= 3 
   alc # a = 1, l = 12, c = 3 
   aaw # a= 1, a =1, w= 23 
   kw # k = 11, w = 23
